A little help
---------------------

I'm trying to make a script to upload images to the site " https://compressor.io/compress " with the objective of optimizing the images. However it seems that I am not able to send the information corretar to the site with that it returns me a json {' files' : [ False ]} and should be : { files: Object} .
